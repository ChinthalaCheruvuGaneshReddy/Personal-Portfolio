# Personal-Portfolio
This my Personal Portfolio, I developed this portfolio by my self.

In this project, I utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and visually appealing website that showcases my education, skills, and personal journey. The website highlights my academic achievements, including my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering, and my ongoing master's studies. It also details the technical skills I have honed, such as Java Full Stack development and proficiency in frontend and backend technologies. Through this project, I aimed to present not just a portfolio but a narrative that reflects my passion for technology and my continuous pursuit of knowledge and growth in the field.
